#PivotTable.js

PivotTable.js is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI and originally written in CoffeeScript by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com) at [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com). It is available under an MIT license (see bottom of this document).

##What does it do?

PivotTable.js' basic function is to turn a data set into a summary table and then optionally add a true 2-d drag'n'drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects. With optional add-ons, the summary table can be rendered various kinds of charts, turning the pivot table into a pivot chart.

##Why is it good?

* lightweight: the core (without chart support) is a single file with less than 1000 LOC of CoffeeScript, compiles down to 6.3kb of Javascript minified and gzipped, depends only on jQuery and jQueryUI's 'sortable'
* works wherever jQuery and jQueryUI work (tested with jQuery 1.8.3 and jQueryUI 1.9.2)
* works acceptably fast in Chrome on commodity hardware up to around a hundred thousand records, depending on the cardinality of the attributes.
* UI is [localizable](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization)
* layered architecture allows for summary table generation with or without the pivot table UI around it (if you don't use the UI, then there is no dependency on jQueryUI)
* works with common [input formats](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats)
* [derived attributes](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Derived-Attributes) can be created on the fly based on the whole input record by passing in a function
* complex [aggregation functions](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators) can compute values based on the whole input record (e.g. weighted averages)
* built-in support for basic heatmap and bar chart [renderers](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers), and optional extra renderers that add [charting or TSV export support](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers)
* extension points allow aggregation functions, table output, UI and visualizations to be tailored to specific applications
* works on mobile devices with jQuery UI Touch Punch


##Where's the demo?

There are lots on the [examples page](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/index.html) but here are some good entry points:

* [a simple demo running on the "Canadian Parliament 2012" dataset](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html)
* [fully-loaded demo running on the 700+ datasets that ship with R](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/rcsvs.html)
* [fully-loaded demo where you provide a CSV file for input](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/fully_loaded.html)

##How do I use the UI?

PivotTable.js implements a pivot table drag'n'drop UI similar to that found in popular spreadsheet programs. You can drag attributes into/out of the row/column areas, and choose a summary function. There is a [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/UI-Tutorial) in the wiki but the following animation gives you a taste of the interaction. It's based on the [Canadian Parliament 2012 dataset](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/examples/mps.csv).

##How do I use the code?

You first need to load jQuery and the PivotTable.js scripts (`pivot.min.js` and any plugins or source maps), which can be done the normal way (download the files from the [`dist`](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/tree/master/dist) directory and reference them), or loaded from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable), or via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) with `npm install pivottable` or via [Bower](http://bower.io/) with `bower install pivottable`.

There are two main functions provided by PivotTable.js: `pivot()` and `pivotUI()`, both implemented as jQuery plugins, as well as a bunch of helpers and templates.

### `pivot()`

Once you've loaded jQuery and pivot.js, this code ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple.html)):

	$("#output").pivot(
	    [
	        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
	        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
	    ],
	    {
	        rows: ["color"],
	        cols: ["shape"]
	    }
	);

appends this table to `$("#output")` (the default, *overridable* behaviour is to populate the table cells with counts):

### `pivotUI()`

A slight change to the code (calling `pivotUI()` instead of `pivot()` ) yields the same table with a drag'n'drop UI around it, so long as you've imported jQueryUI ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple_ui.html)):

	$("#output").pivotUI(
	    [
	        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
	        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
	    ],
	    {
	        rows: ["color"],
	        cols: ["shape"]
	    }
	);

Note that **`pivot()` and `pivotUI()` take different parameters in general**, even though in the example above we passed the same parameters to both.
